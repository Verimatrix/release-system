<h3>What's new</h3>

<p>
	<strong>Liar mode</strong>.
	Lie in the XML update file, telling Joomla that the package supports the next Joomla minor version, and the next entirety of the next major version. This is an unfortunate necessity for Joomla's pre-update checks to stop slandering your software to your clients, telling them it's not compatible with the upcoming Joomla version and/or that there is no upgrade path. The downside is that it will allow old versions of your software to appear as updates on old, unsupported sites where installing them might just as well break the site. I told the Joomla core maintainers four times in the year prior to Joomla 4's release that this would eventually happen. Oh well, call me names instead of listening to me and figure out how to fix your broken code when it's too late (or, as kids say these days, “f…k around and find out”).

	<strong>Add show unauthorized links options to automatic item description</strong>. You can now set up this option in the Automatic Item Description so that new items get this option set if you so wish, without having to remember to do this manually.
