<h3>What's new</h3>

<p>
	<strong>Minimum Joomla 4.2 and PHP 8.0</strong>. Remember that Joomla 5 is less than a year away with a minimum PHP version requirement of 8.1.
</p>

<p>
	<strong>Dashboard</strong>. The old control panel page has been replaced with a native Joomla dashboard. You can add modules to it, or re-arrange items to fit your workflow.
</p>

<p>
	<strong>Removed PHP version warnings</strong>. Joomla displays its own.
</p>

<p>
	<strong>Warnings are now DETAILS elements</strong>. More compact, by default they only display a header. Click on the header to see the longer message.
