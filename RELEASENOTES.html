<h3>What's new</h3>

<p>
	<strong>Component option for the Router ItemID behaviour</strong>. Set the new option “Use ItemID to build SEF URLs” to Yes if you are using this component on your own site. The default behaviour of the ARS Router <em>is not</em> the typical way Joomla component routers work for reasons that have to do with the way we want it to work on our site.
</p>

<p>
	<strong>Bug fixes and minor improvements</strong>. Please take a look at the CHANGELOG below.
</p>
